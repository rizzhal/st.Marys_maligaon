                    St. John Bosco, popularly known as Don Bosco (Italian for Father Bosco), was born at
                    Becchi, in Piedmont, Italy on August 16, 1815. From a very young age he was called to
                    work for poor young people of his time, when Europe was under the grip of Industrial
                    Revolution and many a young person who came to the cities to study or in search of
                    work fell an easy prey to the many social evils of his time.

                    He lost his father at the age of 2 and was brought up by his mother, who was truly his
                    guide, his model and his educator. From early years of life he discovered his leadership
                    qualities especially among his peers. At the age of nine little John Bosco was given a
                    mission in vision. He was to transform the young people{' '}
                    <span className="italic">“NOT WITH BLOWS BUT WITH LOVING KINDNESS”</span> that was the
                    goal of his life. Overcoming untold hardships and hostility he become a priest on
                    June 5th 1841. His determination to be a priest for young people combined with his
                    dynamic optimism resulted in the flowering of his long cherished goal.

                  His Educational Vision
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Don Bosco was an educational practitioner rather than educational theorist. It is
                  impossible to understand his approach to education without reference to his experiences
                  in life, because he actually incorporated the lessons of his own life experiences into
                  his pedagogy. This style of education consists in involving young people, their parents
                  or guardians and the educators in a family atmosphere. This system is based on{' '}
                  <strong>Reason</strong>, <strong>Religion</strong> (Faith in God) and{' '}
                  <strong>Loving Kindness</strong>. The goal is integral formation. This embraces
                  developing physical, intellectual, moral, social and spiritual aspects of person’s life.
